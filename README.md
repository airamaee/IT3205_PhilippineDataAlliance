# Project Title: The Future Pay: Effects of Increasing Minimum Wage in the Philippines

**Introduction**

Households in extreme poverty and low-income families in the Philippines struggle and suffer as they lack access to valuable assets and basic necessities, resulting in hunger, unemployment, and restricted access to sustain their everyday lives. They mainly rely on one of their family member's hard work, beg on the street, and sometimes do things that can generate income merely to live. Some are forced to endure their situations and skip their meals just to ensure that their earnings are sufficient for them to last a week. However, there are also government initiatives and services available to help them, such as the Pantawid Pamilya Pilipino Program (4Ps) to alleviate their needs. To survive their situation, they will need to work day and night to prolong productivity and get higher pays because of the low minimum wage mandated by the Law.
