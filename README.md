# Project Title: The Future Pay: Analysis on the Potential Effects of Increasing Minimum Wage in the Philippines

<h3> Introduction </h3>

Households in extreme poverty and low-income families in the Philippines struggle and suffer as they lack access to valuable assets and basic necessities, resulting in hunger, unemployment, and restricted access to sustain their everyday lives. They mainly rely on one of their family member's hard work, beg on the street, and sometimes do things that can generate income merely to live. Some are forced to endure their situations and skip their meals just to ensure that their earnings are sufficient for them to last a week. However, there are also government initiatives and services available to help them, such as the Pantawid Pamilya Pilipino Program (4Ps) to alleviate their needs. But usually, to survive their situation, they will need to work day and night to prolong productivity and get higher pays because of the low minimum wage mandated by the Law. The minimum wage is really important because it establishes the lowest compensation that a business may pay its  employees in order to provide them with social security and help raise their standard of living. The Philippines is considered as one of the worst countries to live on minimum wage since we have one of the lowest minimum pay rankings among all countries (Picodi, 2020). Under the current labor regulations of DOLE, minimum wages in the Philippines have remained unchanged at Php 537/ day from 2019 to the present,  which is insufficient to meet basic necessities such as food, water, health, education, and electricity, especially in light of the pandemic and rising commodity prices in the market today.
 
In this light, the analysis of this study focuses on its objectives to develop a labor policy and recommendation of an action plan for raising the minimum wage of the Filipinos, which will not only help combat poverty and unemployment in the Philippines but will also encourage economic growth and development in the country. Changes to minimum wages are necessary to sustain its relevance in fluctuating economic and social realities from time to time. The goal of this project is to also encourage more Filipinos to stay in the Philippines and work for our own country, which again will empower and benefit the Philippines by providing possibilities for growth to our economy and optimizing the Filipino skills and intelligence that we have rather than going abroad away from their families and sometimes experience kinds of discrimination and abuse. 

<h3> Problem Statement </h3>

Based on a survey conducted by the World Economic Forum in 2019, the Philippine youth still prefers to work overseas owing to the country's high unemployment rate, better opportunities,  higher salaries and higher minimum wage given in other countries compared to working here. It is evident that economic growth in the Philippines is quite low since Filipinos choose to work abroad granting them more gains and expansion for other nations while leaving our own country behind in terms of economic progress. Another problem here is that the Philippine labor population is not completely employed since a certain number of "working-age" Filipinos in the country are either unemployed or underemployed, at almost twice the level of our neighbouring countries. According to the Labor Force Survey performed by the Philippine Statistics Authority in January 2022, 2.93 million Filipinos are unemployed at 6.4 percent, which is excellent news because it indicates a decrease from the percentage recorded the previous year. However, when compared to other nations, the Philippines' unemployment rate appears to be high, necessitating additional analysis and attention.

According to a recent Labor Force survey done in December 2021, the Philippines' unemployment rate increased slightly to 6.6 percent from 6.5 percent recorded in November 2021. The overall number of jobless people was predicted to reach 3.27 million, up 113 thousand from 3.16 million in November 2021. This also implies that the higher the unemployment rate, the more difficult it is for Filipinos to satisfy their basic necessities. The visible underemployment rate, defined as the proportion of those working less than 40 hours per week who expressed a desire to work more hours in their current job, find another job, or find a new job with longer working hours, was estimated to be 9.8 percent in December 2021, down from 11.5 percent in November of the same year. Invisibly underemployed persons, or those working at least 40 hours per week but expressing a desire for more hours of work in their current job, another job, or a future career with longer working hours, were expected to account for 4.9 percent of all employed individuals in December 2021. This was less than the 5.2 percent forecast for November 2021. Filipinos are losing morale as a result of the unemployment situation, as well as the low wages they are receiving. What and how do you think Filipinos do in their daily lives with such a low minimum wage?

<h3> Significance of the Proposed Project </h3>

<h3> Methods </h3>

The researchers will utilize the datasets that they have acquired provided by the Philippine Statistics Authority to assess and predict possible effects of increasing the minimum wage here in the Philippines and be able to know if its effective, possible or not? 

The approaches for analyzing the mentioned datasets and their relevant relationships with one another are as follows:
