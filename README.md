# The Future Pay: Analysis on the Potential Effects of Increasing Minimum Wage in the Philippines

<h3> Introduction </h3>

Households in extreme poverty and low-income families in the Philippines struggle and suffer as they lack access to valuable assets and basic necessities, resulting in hunger, unemployment, and restricted access to sustain their everyday lives. They mainly rely on one of their family member's hard work, beg on the street, and sometimes do things that can generate income merely to live. Some are forced to endure their situations and skip their meals just to ensure that their earnings are sufficient for them to last a week. However, there are also government initiatives and services available to help them, such as the Pantawid Pamilya Pilipino Program (4Ps) to alleviate their needs. But usually, to survive their situation, they will need to work day and night to prolong productivity and get higher pays because of the low minimum wage mandated by the Law. The minimum wage is really important because it establishes the lowest compensation that a business may pay its  employees in order to provide them with social security and help raise their standard of living. The Philippines is considered as one of the worst countries to live on minimum wage since we have one of the lowest minimum pay rankings among all countries (Picodi, 2020). Under the current labor regulations of DOLE, minimum wages in the Philippines have remained unchanged at Php 537/ day from 2019 to the present,  which is insufficient to meet basic necessities such as food, water, health, education, and electricity, especially in light of the pandemic and rising commodity prices in the market today.
 
In this light, the analysis of this study focuses on its objectives to develop a labor policy and recommendation of an action plan for raising the minimum wage of the Filipinos, which will not only help combat poverty and unemployment in the Philippines but will also encourage economic growth and development in the country. Changes to minimum wages are necessary to sustain its relevance in fluctuating economic and social realities from time to time. The goal of this project is to also encourage more Filipinos to stay in the Philippines and work for our own country, which again will empower and benefit the Philippines by providing possibilities for growth to our economy and optimizing the Filipino skills and intelligence that we have rather than going abroad away from their families and sometimes experience kinds of discrimination and abuse. 

<h3> Problem Statement </h3>

**Growing Rate of Labor Migration.** Based on a survey conducted by the World Economic Forum in 2019, the Philippine youth still prefers to work overseas owing to the country's high unemployment rate, better opportunities,  higher salaries and higher minimum wage given in other countries compared to working here. It is evident that economic growth in the Philippines is quite low since Filipinos choose to work abroad granting them more gains and expansion for other nations while leaving our own country behind in terms of economic progress. 

**Unemployment Rate falls but Job Quality worsens.** Another problem is that the Philippine labor population is not completely employed since a certain number of "working-age" Filipinos in the country are either unemployed or underemployed, at almost twice the level of our neighbouring countries. According to the Labor Force Survey performed by the Philippine Statistics Authority in January 2022, 2.93 million Filipinos are unemployed at 6.4 percent, which is excellent news because it indicates a decrease from the percentage recorded the previous year. However, when compared to other nations, the Philippines' unemployment rate appears to be high, necessitating additional analysis and attention. This also suggests that the higher the unemployment rate, the more difficult it is for Filipinos to satisfy their basic necessities. The visible underemployment rate, defined as the proportion of those working less than 40 hours per week who expressed a desire to work more hours in their current job, find another job, or find a new job with longer working hours, was estimated to be 9.8 percent in December 2021, down from 11.5 percent in November of the same year. Filipinos are losing morale as a result of the unemployment situation, as well as the low wages they are receiving. With such a low minimum salary, what do you believe Filipinos do in their daily lives?

 **Growing Population and Poverty.** Another concern here is the rising percentage of poverty among poor Filipinos whose income per capita is inadequate to cover their basic needs, which was estimated at 23.7 percent or the equivalent of 26.14 million Filipinos whose living below the poverty line (Dennis Mapa, 2021). This is because even if some members of poor households work, they still get P537/day which is incapable of meeting the everyday needs of a single household, according to the Picodi study in 2020.

<h3> Significance of the Proposed Project </h3>

This research is highly significant to the following recipients:

**To the citizens and the community.** To the citizens and the community. This project allows them to have an insight into the trends with regards to the issues. They needed to be able to attain knowledge of the key benefits they can attain once the issues are addressed. It would allow the citizens and the community to be educated and have their rights to labor more protected.

**To the Department of Labor and Employment (DOLE) and the government.** This project enables them to have useful information for the improvement and alignment of their policies. They can strengthen their laws and norms even further, as well as the concreteness of their initiatives. The government can serve as a link between citizens and opportunities by acting as a bridge, especially among those in the poor sector. The project will be beneficial to them because it will allow them to provide better service to the people while also raising awareness.
 
**To the Filipino workers and employees.** The result of the project creates a better understanding of the key factors and benefits of the adjusted minimum wage fare for workers and employees. This project will assist in making every worker aware of the changes that a wage increase can bring. The information formed is utilized to increase employees' awareness and attention to the problem of the minimum wage in the Philippines.
